INSTALLATION:

Open the Terminal app, and download the latest NetworkStatusWarden.pkg installer to your desktop by typing the following command. 

	curl -k --silent --retry 3 --retry-max-time 6 --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/NetworkStatusWarden/master/SupportFiles/NetworkStatusWarden.pkg --output ~/Desktop/NetworkStatusWarden.pkg

To install, double-click the downloaded package.

The installer will install the following files and directories:

	/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.github.execriez.networkstatuswarden.plist
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/NetworkStatusWarden
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/NetworkStatusWarden-InterfaceDown
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/NetworkStatusWarden-InterfaceUp
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/NetworkStatusWarden-NetworkDown
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/NetworkStatusWarden-NetworkUp

There's no need to reboot.

After installation, your computer will write to the log file /tmp/NetworkStatusWarden.log whenever the network comes up or goes down. 

If the installer fails you should check the installation logs.


MODIFYING THE EXAMPLE SCRIPTS

After installation, four simple example scripts can be found in the following location:

	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/NetworkStatusWarden-InterfaceDown
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/NetworkStatusWarden-InterfaceUp
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/NetworkStatusWarden-NetworkDown
	/usr/NetworkStatusWarden/bin/NetworkStatusWarden-NetworkUp

These scripts simply write to the log file /tmp/NetworkStatusWarden.log whenever the network comes up or goes down. Modify the scripts to your own needs.


LOGS:

The example scripts write to the following log file:

	/tmp/NetworkStatusWarden.log

The installer writes to the following log file:

	/Library/Logs/com.github.execriez.networkstatuswarden.log
  
You should check this log if there are issues when installing.
